\chapter{Appendix A Title}
\label{app:A}

This is an appendix. You should use an appendix for material which is important to 
present to the audience but which would distract the audience from the message 
if it were included in the main text. \\

An example is a long proof which is not central to the discussion in your main text. 
Another example is some software code that you think illustrates an idea. 
I would advise you not put large amounts of software code in the appendix because 
it is rather useless for the audience. People would use your code if it's available 
in digital form. Nobody wants to digitize your code. You can put a link to your 
code in your thesis.

\label{sec:appA:section_two}

Another section in the appendix.
