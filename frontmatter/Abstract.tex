% UW requirement:
% (1) Abstract (if required by the Department) should be in the Table of contents.
% This abstract is not limited by number of words and UW does not require this abstract.
% (2) UW requires a ProQuest/UMI abstract, which is subject to max 350 words, 
% should be approved by the advisor(s) and is to be provided as plain text on a website.
%
% My plan: Write the Department abstract. Then shorten the it to within 350 words 
% to create the ProQuest/UMI abstract and store that a text file.

% Add Abstract to TOC
